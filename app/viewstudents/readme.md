## Usage

To use the `page` component in your application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `page` component into your application, typically within the route or URL where you want to display the dashboard page.

2. Ensure that both the `Dashboard` and `ViewStudents` components are defined and available for use within your application. These components should be designed separately in your codebase.

3. Customize the `page` component to meet your specific requirements. You can adjust the layout, styles, and other content as needed.

4. Make sure that the routing and navigation of your application are properly set up to allow users to access the dashboard page (e.g., at `/dashboard` or another designated URL).
